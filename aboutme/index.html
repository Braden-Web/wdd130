    <p>"Hi everyone! I am a business management student who will graduate at the end of this semester. I'm taking this class because I will be working in the gaming industry and having any knowledge of coding is valuable. I've been working with recruiters from Blizzard Entertainment for a while now and hope to get a job with them in the coming months! I'm also currently trying my hand at streaming and content creation around gaming and will continue to do so until I achieve my dreams of doing it full time."</p>
    <p>"I am originally from Hawaii with some of my main hobbies being MMA, weightlifting, and gaming. I've spent a lot of time working at a UFC Gym in Hawaii and meeting many famous UFC fighters. I also love networking on LinkedIn and have put a ton of work into it. My networking is actually how I was able to meet a lot of the people at Blizzard. I cannot wait to get to know you all and excel in this class! Good luck!"</p>
