                RaidBots is the best resource when it comes to properly gearing out your character. If you use it correctly you can gain some serious power in a short amount of time. Like WoWHead though it has many features. We will start by reviewing two of them. We will start with the most fun feature, the Quick Sim. This feature allows you to theoretically test your maximum damage per second (DPS) with your current talents and gear. You can change the scenario with the fight style, number of mobs, fight length, etc. To begin you will type in the region and realm your character is on followed by their name. Afterwards you will adjust the simulation according to what you want to test. The most used simulation options are a fight style of Patchwerk, 1 boss, and a fight length of 3 minutes. This will test your single target DPS. To test your area of effect DPS you would want to change the number of bosses to 4 or above.

                The Droptimizer feature is one that can help you target farm your best gear. To start you will again type in your region, realm, and character name. From here you will select what place you want to farm your gear along with the difficulty. It is important to note that the higher the difficulty the better the gear. Your character won't be able to complete some of the harder difficulties until you have gotten sufficient item level/gear score. Run the simulation. After the simulation is compelete it will give you a list of which items you should prioritize most when it comes to increasing your power. You now know which enemies to farm in game!
